## 🔍 About frankenjax

frankenjax is a clean, well-made version of JAX features. It uses the Rust programming language to remake key JAX functions like `jit`, `grad`, and `vmap`. These features help speed up and simplify machine learning and math tasks. It also provides a smart way to manage code transformations with a trace ledger and cache keys that always work the same. This makes it a good tool for anyone needing stable and predictable numerical computing.

## 🎯 Why Use frankenjax?

- **Speed:** Runs complex math faster using ahead-of-time compilation.
- **Accurate Gradients:** Automatically finds derivatives useful for learning.
- **Flexible Mapping:** Runs the same computation over many inputs.
- **Stable Cache:** Saves time by remembering past work reliably.
- **Rust Safety:** Written in Rust, which helps prevent many bugs.
- **Open Source:** Free for anyone to use and improve.

frankenjax helps those working with advanced math or machine learning. It works behind the scenes so your apps run faster and more smoothly.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

Before installing frankenjax, make sure your system meets these needs:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+ or equivalent)
- **CPU:** 64-bit processor (Intel or AMD)
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB RAM for basic use; 8 GB or more recommended for big tasks
- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB free space for installation and cache
- **Software:** No special software needed for basic use. Rust compiler recommended if you want to build from source.

If you are unsure, most modern PCs or laptops bought in the last 5 years will meet these requirements.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide will help you download and run frankenjax with no programming needed.

### Step 1: Download frankenjax

Go to the frankenjax release page where official files are kept:

👉 [Visit this page to download frankenjax](https://github.com/Jedediahanimatistic632/frankenjax/releases)

Look for the latest release (usually the top one) and choose the file that matches your system.

- On Windows, this might be a `.exe` file.
- On macOS or Linux, you may see `.tar.gz` or binary files.

If you see several files, pick the one labeled for your operating system.

Save the file to an easy-to-find location on your computer, like your Downloads folder.

### Step 2: Install frankenjax

- **Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` file you downloaded. If prompted, allow it to run. Follow any on-screen instructions just like installing any other program.
  
- **macOS/Linux:** You may need to open Terminal (the command-line app). Navigate to your download folder (e.g., `cd Downloads`) and run `chmod +x frankenjax-file-name` to make it executable. Then type `./frankenjax-file-name` to run it.

If you need more detailed instructions for your system, there are guides online for running downloaded programs.

### Step 3: Run frankenjax

Once installed, open frankenjax by clicking the app icon or running the command in Terminal as shown above.

A simple window or command prompt should appear. This means frankenjax is ready to use.

## 📂 How frankenjax Works

frankenjax helps with complicated math tasks by using three main functions:

- **JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation:** Speeds up math by converting code into faster machine code right before running.
- **Grad (Gradient):** Finds the slope or rate of change, which is essential for training machine learning models.
- **Vmap (Vectorized Map):** Runs math over many different inputs at the same time without extra effort.

The program uses special internal tools to keep track of all these steps with a ledger and caches results so repeated work doesn’t slow you down.

These tools make frankenjax good for people running math-heavy projects on their computers.

## 🧰 Features at a Glance

- Rust-based, making it reliable and memory-safe.
- Supports JAX-like math tasks without needing Google’s original setup.
- Keeps track of code changes cleanly for easier debugging.
- Creates deterministic keys for cache management, so results are consistent.
- Includes testing tools that check if calculations match expected results.
- Works as a standalone tool or part of other projects.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Tips

If you run into trouble, try these simple checks:

- Make sure you downloaded the file for your operating system.
- Confirm you have enough disk space and memory.
- Try restarting your computer.
- Check if any security software blocked the program.
- Look for an error message; copy it and search online for help.

If problems persist, consider asking for help on the frankenjax GitHub issues page.
